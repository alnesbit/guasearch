**THIS SOFTWARE ACCESSES AN OLD VERSION OF THE GUARDIAN API AND IS KNOWN NOT TO WORK CURRENTLY.**

guasearch is small, simple web application which allows a user to
search for articles on The Guardian's website
(http://www.guardian.co.uk) using simple queries.

The aim of this project is primarily to learn about the Guardian's
Open Platform Content API (http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform)
and Google's App Engine infrastructure and webapp2 framework.  The
focus is on back end development, so the front end interface is bare.

It is installed at http://guasearch.appspot.com

The source code is at http://github.com/alnesbit/guasearch
